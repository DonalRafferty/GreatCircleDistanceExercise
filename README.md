# Great Circle Distance Exercise

This is a simple example exercise that demonstrates the Great Circle Distance or Haversine formula for calculating the distance between two points on a sphere.

It is a simple application based on the MEAN stack that allows a user to enter a distance (EG: 100km) and it will calculate the distance to certain customers who's information it gets from a file
containing customers in JSON object format.
